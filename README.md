## 1. RegEx, Patterns, and Intro to Databases
* Task
    * Consider a database table, Emails, which has the attributes First Name and Email ID. Given  rows of data simulating the Emails table, print an alphabetically-ordered list of people whose email address ends in .

* Input Format

  * The first line contains an integer, , total number of rows in the table.
  * Each of the  subsequent lines contains  space-separated strings denoting a person's first name and email ID, respectively.

* Constraints
  
  * Each of the first names consists of lower case letters  only.
  * Each of the email IDs consists of lower case letters ,  and  only.
  * The length of the first name is no longer than 20.
  * The length of the email ID is no longer than 50.

* Output Format

  * Print an alphabetically-ordered list of first names for every user with a gmail account. Each name must be printed on a new line.

## 2. Running Time and Complexity
* Task
   * A prime is a natural number greater than that has no positive divisors other than  and itself. Given a number,*n*, determine and print whether it is prime or non-prime.
   
   
* Input Format
   * The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases.
   * Each of the T subsequent lines contains an integer, n, to be tested for primality.

* Constraints
   * $1 \le T \le 30$
   * $1 \le n \le 2*10^{9}$

* Output Format
   * For each test case, print whether n is *prime* or *non-prime* on a new line.
